# Milestone 2 demo script to convert Android.bp modules in //bionic/libc to
# buildable Bazel BUILD targets. Run "./demo help" for more info.

  cat <<EOF
A demo script for the Android.bp to BUILD file converter.

Usage:

  ./demo.sh generate -- runs the bp2build converter to generate BUILD files from Android.bp files.
  ./demo.sh sync -- syncs the generated BUILD files from the output directory into the source tree.
  ./demo.sh query -- runs the bazel query command for all targets in //bionic/libc, recursively.
  ./demo.sh build -- runs the bazel build command for all targets in //bionic/libc, recursively.
  ./demo.sh full -- runs the generate, sync, query and build steps in sequence.
  ./demo.sh cleanup -- cleans up the generated BUILD files from the source tree.
  ./demo.sh help -- prints this message.
